How to get started with TWS API (Python):
------------------------------------------
1. Download IBKR’s trading platform (either TWS or IB Gateway)
    TWS - https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/tws.php#tws-software  
    IB Gateway - https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/ibgateway-latest.php | https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/ibgateway-stable.php

2. Download TWS API - https://interactivebrokers.github.io/  

3. Run the setup.py file in Command Prompt / Anaconda prompt - https://ibkrcampus.com/ibkr-api-page/trader-workstation-api/#setup-python
    cd C:\TWS API\source\pythonclient
    python setup.py install

4. Enable TWS or IB Gateway to accept incoming API connections:
    TWS -> Login -> File/Edit (top-left corner) -> Global Configuration -> API -> Settings -> check off: “Enable ActiveX & Socket clients” -> Socket port = 7496 (for Live account) or 7497 (for the Paper account) -> Ok
    IB Gateway -> Login -> “Enable ActiveX & Socket clients” should be checked-off by default -> move on to step 5

5. Connect your Python code to TWS/IB Gateway in order to place trades, retrieve market data, retrieve account balances, etc.




NOTE on reccomended socket ports:
---------------------------------
TWS Live (socket port) = 7496
TWS Paper (socket port) = 7497
IB Gateway Live (socket port) = 4001
IB Gateway Paper (socket port) = 4002
