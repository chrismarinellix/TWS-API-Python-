How to get started with TWS API (Python):
----------------------------------------- 
1. Download IBKR’s trading platform (either TWS or IB Gateway)
    TWS - https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/tws.php#tws-software  
    IB Gateway - https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/ibgateway-latest.php | https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/ibgateway-stable.php

2. Download TWS API - https://interactivebrokers.github.io/  

3. (For Python users ONLY) - run the setup.py file in Command Prompt / Anaconda prompt - https://ibkrcampus.com/ibkr-api-page/trader-workstation-api/#setup-python  
    Open Command Prompt (or "Terminal" for MAC/UNIX)
    cd C:\TWS API\source\pythonclient
    python setup.py install

4. Enable TWS or IB Gateway to accept incoming API connections:
    TWS -> Login -> File/Edit (top-left corner) -> Global Configuration -> API -> Settings -> check off: “Enable ActiveX & Socket clients” -> Socket port = 7496 (for Live account) or 7497 (for the Paper account) -> Ok
    IB Gateway -> Login -> “Enable ActiveX & Socket clients” should be checked-off by default -> move on to step 5

5. Connect your Python code to TWS/IB Gateway in order to place trades, retrieve market data, retrieve account balances, etc.



How to access the IBKR Paper account:
-------------------------------------
Login to www.ibkr.com -> Settings (top-right corner via “Welcome + your name”) -> choose: Paper Trading Account -> Your paper account's username & password may be retrieved here if needed



How to enable API Logging (reccomended):
----------------------------------------
TWS
   1. TWS -> File/Edit (top-left corner) -> Global Configuration -> API -> Settings -> check the box "Create API Message Log file" - > set the logging level to "Detail"  -> Ok
   2. New requests will generate API logs
   3. TWS -> Help (top-left corner) -> Troubleshooting -> Diagnostics -> API Logs   |  TWS -> Help (top-left corner) -> Troubleshooting -> Upload Diagnostics -> Submit

IB Gateway
   1. IB Gateway -> Configure (top-left corner) -> Settings -> API -> Settings -> check the box "Create API Message Log file" -> set the logging level to "Detail"  -> Ok
   2. New requests will generate API logs
   3. IB Gateway -> File (top-left corner) -> API Logs   |  IB Gateway -> ctrl+alt+h (simulaneously on your keyboard) -> Submit 



NOTE on reccomended socket ports:
---------------------------------
TWS Live (socket port) = 7496
TWS Paper (socket port) = 7497
IB Gateway Live (socket port) = 4001
IB Gateway Paper (socket port) = 4002



General TWS / TWS API troubleshooting:
--------------------------------------
•	Ensure “Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients” is checked in TWS:
    TWS -> File/Edit (top-left corner) -> Global Configuration -> API -> Settings -> “Enable ActiveX & Socket clients” is checked? -> Socket Port set here matches your code?

•	Try switching TWS versions
    TWS -> File -> Change Version -> switch from Latest to Stable (or vice versa) 

•	Try unique IB Gateway versions 
    Latest | Stable

•	TWS Memory Allocation was increased above the 768 default? See: https://www.interactivebrokers.com/lib/cstools/faq/#/content/32642126
    TWS -> File/Edit (top-left corner) -> Global Configuration -> General -> set the Memory Allocation (in MB) -> Ok

•	Try running TWS/IB Gateway on a different network/machine (if possible)

•	(Optionally) try a fresh install of TWS API
•	(Optionally) try Python samples on GitHub
