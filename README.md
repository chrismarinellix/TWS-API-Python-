Purpose - 
The content included here demonstrates Python implementations for TWS API. This should not be used as an example of a perfect trading system, but a means of implementing Interactive Broker's TWS API with standard Python libraries.

Note about TWS API - 
TWS API is designed to programmatically interact with the TWS/IB Gateway trading software via a local socket connection. Official programming languages (of TWS API) are C++ / C# / Java / Python / VB.NET. Additionally, Excel (ActiveX, DDE, & RTD Server) may be used. TWS API has a request limitation of 50 requests per second (i.e. no more than “50 orders per second”).
